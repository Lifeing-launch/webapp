# üèÜ Drink Log Achievements Guide

## üîÑ How the System Works

### Goal Periods

- A **goal period** starts when you set your initial goals
- A **new period** begins each time you change any goal (daily, weekly, or monthly)
- You can earn **ONE of each badge type per goal period**
- Past badges are preserved when you change goals

### Automatic Evaluation

1. **When the page loads**: System checks your goal periods within last 180 days
2. **After logging drinks**: Achievements are re-evaluated for current period
3. **When goals change**: New period begins, new badges become available

### Tracking Period

- Default check: **Last 180 days**
- Evaluates all goal periods within this range
- All calculations use **America/New_York timezone**

### Badge Award Process

## üìä Goal Settings Required

Before you can earn badges, you must set your drinking goals:

| Goal Type        | Description              | Example   |
| ---------------- | ------------------------ | --------- |
| **Daily Goal**   | Maximum drinks per day   | 2 drinks  |
| **Weekly Goal**  | Maximum drinks per week  | 10 drinks |
| **Monthly Goal** | Maximum drinks per month | 30 drinks |

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes**:

- Without goals set, no badges can be earned!
- Changing any goal starts a new period
- You keep all previously earned badges

## üîê Technical Details

### Idempotency

- Each badge has a unique key preventing duplicates
- System uses `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` in database

### Period Keys Format (Updated)

- Alcohol Free: `alcohol_free:goal:<goal_id>:<period_start>`
- Daily Target: `daily:goal:<goal_id>:<period_start>`
- Weekly Target: `weekly:goal:<goal_id>:<period_start>`
- Monthly Target: `monthly:goal:<goal_id>:<period_start>`

### Data Tracked

Each badge stores:

- When it was earned (`earned_at`)
- Goal values at time of earning (`goal_snapshot`)
- Relevant metrics (`metrics`: total drinks, etc.)

## ‚ùì FAQ

**Q: Why didn't I get multiple daily badges for my streak?**
A: You get ONE badge per goal period, not per day. The Daily Target Achievement badge means you stayed within your daily limit for the entire period.

**Q: I haven't drunk in 8 days but got only 1 badge?**
A: You should receive multiple badges! With 8 days of no drinking, you should get:

- Alcohol Free Period (after 1 day)
- Daily Target Achievement (after 1 day)
- Weekly Target Achievement (after 7 days)

**Q: Can I earn the same badge multiple times?**
A: Yes, but only when you start a new goal period by changing your goals. Each period allows one of each badge type.

**Q: What happens if I change my goals?**
A: A new goal period begins immediately. You keep all past badges and can earn new ones for the new period.

**Q: Do I need to log 0 drinks or can I just not log anything?**
A: For the new system, days without logs are treated as 0 drinks. You'll still earn badges for staying sober even without logging.

**Q: How far back does the system check?**
A: By default, 180 days. This evaluates all goal periods within that range.

**Q: What timezone is used?**
A: All calculations use America/New_York (Eastern Time) for consistency.

## üìù Summary

The achievement system encourages healthy drinking habits by:

1. **Rewarding moderation** - Stay within your goals across the entire period
2. **Celebrating breaks** - Alcohol-free days are recognized
3. **Building consistency** - Track your progress over goal periods
4. **Providing feedback** - Visual rewards for meeting targets
5. **Encouraging goal adjustment** - Change goals to start fresh periods

**Key Takeaway**: You earn ONE badge of each type per goal period. This prevents badge spam while still rewarding consistent healthy behavior. When you adjust your goals to be more challenging (or realistic), you get a fresh start with new badge opportunities!

Remember: The goal isn't to collect badges, but to build sustainable, healthy habits over time. üåü
